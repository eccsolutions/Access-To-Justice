            Thank you for selecting the following question(s). As a reminder,
            questions are to be answered within three days. If you are in the process of communicating
            with the client(s) and need additional time to provide an answer, please respond to
            this email. Otherwise, you will have one more day to answer the question(s) before
            they will be moved back into the queue so that another volunteer lawyer may assist.
