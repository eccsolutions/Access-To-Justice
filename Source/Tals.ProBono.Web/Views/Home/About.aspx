        About</h2>
    <p>
        The <%=ConfigSettings.AppName %> allows eligible users to post a legal question to a private messaging system. The questions are answered by volunteer attorneys. MLHO users can check the system for answers at any time. Only the website administrator and the volunteer attorney answering a client’s question can see the client’s name. All information posted is held in strict confidence.</p>

        MLHO is administered by the Mississippi Volunteer Lawyers Project (MVLP), a legal nonprofit dedicated to providing free civil legal services to low-income residents of
        Mississippi through pro bono attorneys. Special thanks to BeCloud, LLC, Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, PC, the Mississippi Access to Justice Commission,
        the University of Mississippi School of Law and our other Mississippi partner organizations and stakeholders for their critical support of this project. These entities share
        the goal of increasing access to legal services to those who cannot afford it.</p>
