<h2> About</h2>
About SCLawAnswers is a project of the South Carolina Bar Pro Bono Program. The system screens clients for eligibility and, if qualified, allows them to post a question to a private messaging system. The questions are answered by private attorneys volunteering their time. A SCLawAnswers client has the ability to check the system for answers at any time. Only the name of the client is shared with the volunteer attorney assisting them. All other information is anonymous to insure complete privacy. All information posted is held in strict confidence.<br>
