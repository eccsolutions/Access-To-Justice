        Legal Services Programs They give free legal advice and sometimes a lawyer to represent you in court for free. Mostly they help people whose income is low. Sometimes they help people no matter how much they make. This is mostly people who are abused or over age 60. They don’t take criminal cases, only cases that you can’t go to jail for.</p>
